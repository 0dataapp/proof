# Zero Data Proof

A sample app that integrates with multiple [0data](https://0data.app) protocols

## Architecture

The project is a large collection of mostly small modules and functions that are put together using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org). With the exception of a few 'global' or 'magic' things such as the localization function `OLSKLocalized`, most resources used by a module should be in the same folder or referenced by path name.

Routing, rendering markdown content, and serving pages is done via a Node.js server (usually configured in the *controller.js* files).

## Development Setup

Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), then:

```
npm run setup
```

This should create an `.env` file if there is none. If you encounter errors referring to this file, you can find missing variables in `.env-sample`.

## Running

### Start the Rollup process to build and reload automatically

```
npm run watch
```

### Start the Node.js server to view in the browser

```
npm start
```

It should be accessible at <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a>.
